[![Build Status](https://ci.potatocorp.dev/job/MavenHelper/badge/icon)](https://ci.potatocorp.dev/job/MavenHelper/)

## Can I see it running?
 No, I have taken the project down. With the release of my new alternative project [Nitro_Repo](https://github.com/wherkamp/nitro_repo). This is a general artifact manager but it also includes badges. If you want a full artifact_manager I highly recommend Nitro_Repo. This project is still supported. 
## What can this project do?
 1. Generate Maven Version Badges for custom repositories. Such as [![Maven Version](https://mvnhelper.potatocorp.dev/tuxjsql/me.kingtux/tuxorm/badge.png)](https://mvnhelper.potatocorp.dev/tuxjsql/me.kingtux/tuxorm)
 2. Give Data about accessing repo and depend. [example](https://mvnhelper.potatocorp.dev/tuxjsql/me.kingtux/tuxorm)
 3. Accessing the data via a json API. [example](https://mvnhelper.potatocorp.dev/tuxjsql/me.kingtux/tuxorm/data.json)
## Setting Up. 
  1. Run the jar with Java 11+.
  2. Kill the application.
  3. Configure the config.json.
  4. Start Application
  5. Access your badge at {URL}/{repo-id}/{group-id}/{artifact-id}/badge.png
